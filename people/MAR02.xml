    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This code has been used four times: H Martineau (1834-03-08), (H Martineau) (1834-05-12), H Martineau 
    (1834-06-12), H Martineau (1834-07-06). </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harriet was the daughter of 'Thomas Martineau (1764–1826), a cloth manufacturer descended from an old 
    Huguenot family, and his wife, Elizabeth (1770/71–1848)' (<title xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DNB</title>). Her brother James (1805–1900), Unitarian 
    minister, has a separate <title xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DNB</title> entry. The family were prominent Norwich unitarians and I suggest we might
    need more Martineau keycodes. </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">From her autobiography: Godwin was 'an occasional morning visitor of mine. I looked upon him as a curious monument
    of a bygone state of society; and there was still a good deal that was interesting about him .... My mother and 
    I went, with a mutual friend, to tea at the Godwins' little dwelling under the roof of the Houses of Parliament,
   just before I went to America [describes him giving her letters of introduction] .... On the next Sunday, in came 
   Godwin, in evident uneasiness and awkwardness. He threw his gloves into his hat, as if preparing for some
   great effort; and then he told me, with reluctance and confusion, that he wished to recal his offer of letters to 
   his American correspondents; for this reason:-that I should be known there as a political economist; and, if
   he introduced me, it might be supposed that he had changed his views in his old age, and become one of 
   the order of men against whom he had written in his earlier years .... That last evening at Godwin's was a 
   memorable one to me. The place is gone, and all who were there are dead except myself. Before it grew too
   dusk (it was in July) Godwin took us through the passages of the old Parliament House, and showed us the
   Star Chamber...' (Martineau, <title xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Autobiography</title>, pp. 302-6)</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harriet went to America on 9.8.1834 and left New York to return to England on 1.8.1836, after Godwin's death.
   Martineau entries after August 1834 have therefore been left uncoded.  That leaves only the 'H Martineau's. So Godwin and Harriet Martineau only meet 4 times, all in 
   1834. The first two are at Gaskel's (her name is bracketed in the second meeting) then
   12.6.1834 'Star-chamber; Gaskels, H Martineau and mere at tea.'
   6.7.1834 'Call on H Martineau:'
   which clearly correspond to the meetings Martineau describes above, although she muddles the dates a 
   little and she seems to be elaborating by describing G as 'an occasional morning visitor of mine'.</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Other Martineau entries prior to this period seem to  refer either to <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" key="MAR04">Philip or Thomas Martineau</persName> (1764-1826), or to one of the following:
    </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> 1 -- martinu, lambeth
    1811-02-15 
    I suggest this is also Thomas Martineau - the full entry reads 'Seek Martinu, Lambeth : call on Wordsworth, 
    Gold and Martineau', so likely that 'Martinu' is an abbreviated form of the full name, which Godwin writes in full 
    later in the same entry.</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2 -- mrs martineau
    1835-02-02 1836-01-30 
    This prob refers to Harriet's mother Elizabeth (1770/71-1848) who survives her husband and probably
    merits her own code. As well as the two instances of 'Mrs Martineau' she is denoted by 'Star-chamber; 
    Gaskels, H Martineau and mere at tea.' (12.6.1834) and, all in 1835, by
    18.2 'Mesds Martineau and Kentish at tea.'
    1.3.'Fox (Finsbury), w. Mesds Gaskel and Martineau; adv. S Smith.'
    11.5 'G Jones at tea; adv. mesds Gaskel and Martineau.'
    28.5 'Soir, Gaskel’s, Bowring, L Aikin, Grimstone, Hawkes’s, Owen, Hunter, Holms, Martineau, Jones.'
    I think we can be sure that the last one is Elizabeth even tho there is no 'Mrs' because of the context - 
    meets at Gaskel's, who had met Godwin with Harriet and Elizabeth Martineau the previous year.</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">4 -- p martineau
    1805-09-08 1811-05-15 1811-06-12 1811-11-28 
    P Martineau might well be Norwich surgeon <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" key="MAR04">Philip Meadows Marinteau </persName>(1752-1829), whom Harriet
    refers to in her <title xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Autobiography</title> as 'my eminent uncle' (p. 38). The first meeting is an adv 
    at tea during one of Godwin's visits to Norwich then the first two of the 1811 refs are to meetings in London 
    and the other (28.11) is a letter Godwin writes to him that is not in Abinger scans.  </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">1 -- j martineau
   1811-05-15 
   1 -- martineau jr
    1811-11-29 
    These are likely to refer to some of Harriet's seven siblings. Probably not possible/not worth trying to identify.
    The J Martineau is unlikely to be her younger brother James as it's a 'call on...' and James would only have 
    been 5 or 6 yrs old at the time. If we create the new codes described above then these two entries should
    be the only uncoded Martineaus in the diary. </p></note><bibl xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="printedbook">
