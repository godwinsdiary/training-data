                           and a half pages on his life on 26 October. The piece was
                           first published in the <span class="title">Monthly Magazine</span> that November,
                           republished in the <span class="title">Monthly Mirror</span> for May 1805 and was later

                        <p>Godwin's entries on 23 March, 31 March and 4 April 1810 allow the
                           identification of the previously unattributed letter which appears in the
                           <span class="title">Morning Post</span> on 6 April 1810, signed 'A LOVER OF TRANQUIL
                           IMPROVEMENTS'. The letter argues for the removal of Smithfield market, a
                           subject 'deeply interesting to the quiet and beauty of the metropolis' - and
                           especially so for Godwin as the livestock market was located very near to
                           the Juvenile Library on Skinner Street. Godwin argues that Parliament should
                           help to remove it: 'If there is any thing in a great metropolis which
                           renders the air pestilential, which tends to destroy the bodies or corrupt
                           the morals of its inhabitants, a genuine legislature will .... apply itself
                           to correct the mischief'. However, the House of Commons threw out the Bill
                           for the Removal of Smithfield Market later that month (see <span class="title">Morning
                              Chronicle</span>, 13 April 1810).

                           was published on 25 May, the day that the Commons voted to support the war.
                           The <span class="title">Morning Chronicle</span> turned the second one down and so
                           Godwin published both as a pamphlet under his own name. Once again his
                           timing was unfortunate: the pamphlet appeared on 22 June, four days after
                           Waterloo and the same day <a href="NAP02.html">Napoleon</a> abdicated, and it was quickly withdrawn
                           by Godwin.

                           in the <span class="title">Morning Chronicle</span> on 25 December 1821, which he read
                           as endorsing Malthus's theory of population. The <span class="title">Morning
                              Chronicle</span> preface denies that this is what they had meant and hopes
                           that the letter is not from the same source as one 'written with an asperity
                           quite uncalled for' that had been published in the <span class="title">Examiner</span>
                           the previous Sunday. The <span class="title">Examiner</span> letter is signed 'C', does
                           not read as Godwin's style and might instead be from <a href="COB01.html">William Cobbett</a>, 
                           whose
                           style it more closely matches and who endorsed Godwin's intervention in the
                           population debate in his <span class="title">Political Register</span> ('I have hunted
                           Malthus out of vogue, and almost out of existence: Mr. Godwin has done the

                           with a vast deal more of research', 11.2.1832). This is contrary to the

                        European Magazine
                        <p>Godwin's review claims that <a href="INC01.html">Inchbald's</a> play 'rises above any of her former
                           theatrical essays. The outline of the piece is excellent, and is capable of
                           impressive and exquisite effect'. However, he judges the 'tragic tale'
                           interwoven with the main comic plot to have ''not been equally successful'
                           and accuses Inchbald 'of not obstinately and perseveringly unfolding one
                           idea, till she has placed it in its strongest lights, and suffered it to
                           produce its full effects'. Godwin is also highly critical of the way the
                           piece was acted at Covent Garden: 'the actors, by some fatality, seem not to
                           understand their parts .... we would give to every one that wishes fully to
                           enjoy this comedy, this piece of advice, "Take it with you to your
                           closet."'

                           of dramatic analysis by Godwin came to my attention through a scrap of
                           writing in the Abinger Microfilm: "The paper on Wolsley was written, Apr. 3
                           1809 and appeared in the Morning Chronicle a few days after". This corresponds to 
                           the diary, where Godwin records writing the piece on 3 April after seeing
                           <a href="KEM03.html">Kemble</a> act in <span class="title">Henry VIII</span> on 28 February.

                        <p>The article is
                           signed 'Aristarchus' and argues that 'my friend Kemble' misinterprets
                           Wolsley, failing to represent the 'mangnanimous collectedness of soul' that
                           Wolsley achieves after his fall from Henry's favour. Kemble plays Wolsley as
                           'a poor, broken-hearted wretch, robbed of office and spirit at the same
                           time, and whimpering and wailing in the most pitiful strain', Godwin argues
                           that he should appear as a 'a great man sustaining himself with dignity
                           amidst the storm of his fortune'.

                        <p>There are many occasions when Godwin notes in the diary that he is writing
                           on his own life. It is never pursued in a systematic fashion, he returns to it
                           periodically. Much of this material is published in <span class="title">Novels and
                              Memoirs</span>, vol. 1 from MS. Abinger c. 32, fols. 1-31, 34, 35-6, 41-68, 69, 70-9,  and 
                           MS. Abinger c. 31, fols. 80-9, 90-110, 115-16. It focuses
                           on Godwin's family, his education and his first career as a dissenting
                           minister and goes on to cover in less detail the early 1790s. However, this
                           code also has been used for MS. Abinger c. 32, fol. 33

                           to distinguish the dates that he wrote different sections of his
                           autobiography.

                        <p>Godwin's closest friend <a href="HOL01.html">Thomas Holcroft</a> died on 23 March 1809. After a four
                           year estrangement, they had been reconciled as Holcroft lay dying and Godwin
                           wrote five pages on Holcroft's life between 6th and 12th of the following
                           month.

                        <p>It is likely that Godwin revised some writing by <a href="HOL01.html">Holcroft.</a> who called the day

                           Walks, or First Impressions of Religion' (p. 213). St Clair notes that
                           Godwin refers in a list of his works to 'Rural Walks', published 1806', and which might correspond to the anonymous

                        <p>There is evidence to suggest that Godwin may have written up his diary in
                           large batches from time to time. He may have done this from rough notes
                           which he then transferred en masse to his diary. This would account for
                           occasional dating errors (such as events which appear in the wrong year and
                           are then crossed out) which creep in from time to time and perhaps also explain the consistency
                           of the handwriting.

                           dated 4 October 1824. Godwin argues that three or four hours a day should be
                           fixed for labour and the rest of the time spent with family (to 'cherish the
                           domestic affections'), in the public house ('a theatre of eager and earnest
                           discussion') and in becoming a good and active citizen.

                           editor, 18 April 1815, concerning <a href="NAP02.html">Napoleon</a>. 2 leaves. Godwin quotes a
                           declaration by the Allies which had been carried in an unidentified newspaper from the previous day. 
                           The first phrase of
                           Godwin's quotation matches an article in the previous days's <span class="title">Morning

                           Godwin is paraphrasing). The letter argues that it is unjust for the Allies
                           at Vienna to grant France liberty as long as they do not choose to restore
                           Napoleon, claiming that 'an infinite majority of the French people are eager
                           to adhere to him'. The letter appears not to have been published at the time

                           miscelleaneous items, including notes on his suitability to be an M.P.
                           written c. 1796, notes for ‘Verax, Part II’ dated 8 Dec. 1816, and notes on

                           sheet of paper Godwin has simply written, across the middle of the page, 'I

                           had been reading a life of <a href="BUR10.html">Burke</a> in the days before 18 October, when he
                           entered 'Notes on Burke' in his diary, followed the next day by 'Notes on
                           Horne Tooke'. The single page of notes on Burke read, 'Edmund Burke.
                           asperity intermperance These are qualities which it is particularly painful
                           to discover in the man we especially desire to love and admire It was said
                           of Priestley, that he was never ill-tempered and harsh, but with his pen -
                           may not something analogous to this be predicated of Burke? Meanwhile, it is
                           an infirmity greatly to be lamented - it stops the career of our love, and
                           it greatly detracts from the authority and weight of him in whom it is
                           discovered.' The notes go on to discuss the Burkean sublime: 'the loftiest
                           species of the sublime, especially where moral agents are concerned, is in
                           cases to which sympathy enters .... There must, perhaps always, be the idea
                           of mind included in the sublime - suffering - or triumphant .... B's radical
                           fault is his propensity to divide sublimity fr. sentiment, to reduce it to
                           sensation Music (Handel) is a fine source of it.' Another page of notes
                           discusses Burke's relationship with <a href="FOX01.html">Fox</a>: 'Offended with Mr. Fox for
                           panegyrising democracy at a very improper moment - resolves to check this
                           panegyric .... Accused by Mr. Fox of adopting a conduct calculated to injure
                           him - of contradicting the principles upon which he had formerly acted - of

                        <p>This corresponds to MS. Abinger c. 37, fols. 8-22, Contemporary politics: William Godwin,
                           miscelleaneous items, including notes on his suitability to be an M.P.
                           written c. 1796, notes for ‘Verax, Part II’ dated 8 Dec. 1816, and notes on
                           Edmund Burke, John Horne Tooke and Charles James Fox. 20 leaves. On one
                           sheet of paper Godwin has simply written, across the middle of the page, 'I
                           could write excellent characters of Edmund Burke and John Horne Tooke'. He
                           had been reading a life of Burke in the days before 18 October, when he
                           entered 'Notes on Burke' in his diary, followed the next day by 'Notes on
                           Horne Tooke'. The notes on <a href="TOO01.html">Tooke</a> claim that 'H Tooke was certainly no friend
                           to generous, swelling sentiments of liberty .... He was an avowed advocate
                           for the slave- trade. His scheme of parliamentary reform was, that the rich
                           man should have liberty to buy as many votes as he pleased, for a certain
                           sum to be added to the public revenue. He was hostile to the abolition of
                           trial for libel .... His ideas of right and wrong were very crude .... he
                           had considerable asperity of character, and loved to think that a time would
                           come when public delinquents would expiate their offences.'

                           (paginated 1-8). Godwin describes the Protestant Reformation as 'the dawn of
                           intellectual liberty to man' and the document appears to have been a
                           proposal to publishers for a history of the period: 'no topic can more
                           irresistibly come home to the bosom of almost every reader, than the History
                           of the Protestant Reformation'. In the days before writing the prospectus
                           Godwin had re-read <a href="COB01.html">William Cobbett's</a><span class="title">History of the Protestant

                           partly in note form and styled as a petition from the House of Commons to
                           William IV. Begun two days after the Lords had rejected the Bill for
                           parliamentary reform, it insists that the Commons have been given a popular
                           mandate for reform and that the Bill must be passed.

                        <p>This corresponds to MS. Abinger c. 86, fols. 7-16, Opening section of a work on King Richard

                           (paginated (1)-20). Godwin proposes a more balanced account of Richard III,
                           commenting on the polarised historiography on the subject and trying to
                           evaluate the truth of More and Bacon's accounts, paying particular attention
                           to the fate of the princes in the Tower. The unpublished manuscript does not
                           read as part of a children's history or as a prospectus for publishers of a
                           larger work and may simply be an individual piece of private research,
                           motivated by historical curiosity. It is ends mid-sentence, while narrating
                           the beginning of the pretender Perkin Warbeck's attempts to lay claim to the
                           throne during Henry VII's reign, and the diary confirms that it was not
                           continued beyond page 20.

                           well as being an excellent example of the London audience’s taste for

                           considered it his most important work. The play itself is a 
                           reaction against the garish spectacles of the London theatre which Godwin
                           felt denigrated the function of theatre and it is closely associated with the

                        <p>A collection of essays, Godwin's first for over thirty years which he
                           considered 'the most faultless book I ever printed .... It contains some
                           egotism, but kept perhaps within proper bounds'. 'On Time' has been
                           included, written mostly in January and February 1830, and begun before any of the essays in the volume.
                           It does not directly match any of the titles in the collection, but may
                           correspond to 'Of the Durability of Human Achievements and Productions' or
                           'Of the Duration of Human Life'. Published in one octavo volume and sold at
                           14s.
