    and that he meets W Sharp in 1792. However, we cannot systematically distinguish between entries
    on the basis of the spelling because earlier entries to Sharpe are not exclusively to R Sharp
    since there are entries to 'Sharpe engraver'. Only by 1802 does he seem to have stabilised his
    recognition that Richard Sharp does not have an 'e' at the end - although there is a Sharpe as
    late as 1809, there is no R Sharpe after 1802. What we cannot be certain about, however, is how
    far there is anything systematic underlying the different spelling and the use of initials. </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> It seems plausible to think that the first encounter with William Sharp was  20 October 1792
    when Godwin sees Romney's Paine and a number of other pictures at Sharp's - plausible since Sharp
    engraved Romney's portrait of Paine and would have had reason to have a number of new pictures. The next
    contact on 23 December 1792 is for 'Sharpe [sic] engraver' at Horne Tooke's. In 1793 there are
    five instances of 'Sharpe' all recorded at Horne Tooke's, with neither initial nor 'eng'
    following. They are all Sunday dinners, spread widely across the year. According to Bewley, Horne Tooke
    employed William Sharp to teach his daughters drawing and engraving, and he would often
    stay with the family 'for a week two at a time' while teaching. Richard Sharp also seems to have been
    in London at this time and was also an intimate of Tooke's. Both Sharps seem to have been
    members of the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI), and R Sharp was also a member of the
    Friends of the People. In 1794 the entries continue at Tooke's (and at Newgate with Gerald),
    then involve a number of 'call on' entries after the arrests. Godwin also notes Sharp at Hardy's
    trial. Oddly, at Tooke's trial, where William Sharp gave evidence, the entry is to 'Sharpe Gram'.  
    It is difficult to be certain as to whether these entries are to W or R Sharp, but the involvement 
    of R Sharp with the Friends of the People, and consequently his diminishing involvement with the SCI, 
    suggests that W Sharp is the most likely attribution for this period, both immediately before and after the Treason Trials.</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In 1795 there are two Sharpes at Holcrofts and a Mrs Sharpe at Johnson's (it is clear that R
    Sharp never married, but we have less information about W Sharp). In 1796 there are two meetings, one at
    Holcrofts, the other a plain 'Meet'. In 1797 Godwin distinguishes R Sharp, and there is a single
    plain Sharp on whom he calls in 1798. There are no entries in 1799, then a 'Meet Sharp' and a
    'Sharpe' encountered at Horne Tooke's in 1800. In 1801 there is a 'Meet Sharpe', and a Sharp
    encountered at an Exhibition. In 1802 Godwin has entries for Sharpe and then R
    Sharpe, from Sharp. But in 1805 he reverts to recording two Sharpes and one Sharp, with no
    initials to distinguish them. <lb xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"/>
    
    In 1806, he writes to Sharp, and is written to by Sharp, and then
    notes writing to R Sharp. It seems improbable that he is writing to both R and W Sharp and the
    context suggests that he has a growing intimacy with 
    R Sharp, or desires this in the light of Sharp's wealth. However, St Clair interprets these entries as referring to 
William Sharp     in the light of the one letter that more or less fits the dates
    (the draft letter is dated 16 April while in the diary Godwin records 
    the letters as written on the 15 and 17 April), as referring
    to William Sharp, but it seems more likely to be Richard Sharp. In 1807 there is one Sharp
    entry at a Guildhall dinner involving Sheridan, which given R Sharp's Whig associations seems
    likely to be him. There seems to be a connection for Godwin between Sharp and W Smith, since
    he writes to both on 07 June 1808 and on 26 January 1809. The most plausible link is that they
    are both Whig MPs. On 6 June 1811, he calls on R Sharp who is not at home, and then on 12 June a 'Call on Sharp' takes place. 
    It seems most likely that this is the same person. In
    1815 he enters M from Sharp - following a reasonably long series of R Sharp entries. Then three
    weeks later he enters Meet Sharp, engraver. This strongly suggests that the first entry with
    respect to Marshall is a different Sharp, and in all probability was R Sharp. (coding changed).
    The later Diary entries are much more consistent in their use of R Sharp, with far fewer Sharps
    and Sharpes. But the earlier entries are not so and it is not clear how systematically to
    distinguish them. </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It looks as if, after meeting R Sharp first, Godwin's contacts in 1793, 1794
    and 1795 are predominantly with W Sharp, with links through others who were involved in
    the Treason Trials of 1794. However, it seems possible that contacts with W Sharp decline and
    are increasingly replaced by R Sharp, so that R Sharp dominates the diary, especially from 1806,
    when Godwin is trying to raise money to establish his business on a firm footing, and when he
    sems to be involved in extensive correspondence soliciting support. From this date R Sharp is
    used more systematically, but by no means exclusively, and it remains difficult to judge whether
    plain Sharps (and the odd Sharpe) are to R, or W, or another. On this basis we have created a
    generic <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" key="SHA99">Sharp</persName> file, to hold all entries of Sharp(e) that are indeterminate between W and
    R, taking those in 1793-5 to be W Sharp, and treating occasional Sharps after 1810 as
    plausible R Sharp entries.</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Godwin notes 'W Sharp, engraver, dies, or 25th' on 1824-07-30. The <title xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DNB</title> gives the date of death 
  as 25 July 1824. </p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Sharp entered in 1835, after both W and R Sharp's deaths, is not coded.
